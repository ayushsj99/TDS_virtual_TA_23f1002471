It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.\n\nNow typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.\n\nAlso the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.\n\nThere will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.\n\nThe session is in your course calendar and the meet link is [meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy](http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy)\n\nKind regards", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/48", "answered_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)"}], "topic_id": "topic_161120", "question_id": 47}

You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\n\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.\n\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\n\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\n\nIn the meanwhile:\n\n[ ![The image features a green and blue gradient background with the words \"PORTS EXPLAINED ANIMATED\" prominently displayed.

Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\n\nKind regards", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/90", "answered_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)"}], "topic_id": "topic_161120", "question_id": 89}

So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model.

It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general _idea_ of the task.\n\nThat said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\n\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\n\n\nKind regards", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/103", "answered_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)"}], "topic_id": "topic_164277", "question_id": 102}

This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `\"data\"` key.\n\n\n  1. **Token Verification:**\n\n\n  * I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.\n  * The token is passed in the header as follows:\n\n\n\npython\n\nCopy\n    \n    \n    \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\"\n    \n\n  * I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).\n\n\n  2. **API Request Details:**\n\n\n  * The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.\n  * The payload is set as:\n\n\n\njson\n\nCopy\n    \n    \n    {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]}\n    \n\n  * Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.\n\n\n  3. **Debug Output:**  \nHere’s a snippet of the debug output:\n\n\n\nbash\n\nCopy\n    \n    \n    HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\"\n    🔴 A9 failed: 'data'\n    \n\nThis confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.\n\n\n  * The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.\n  * There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.\n  * Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your assistance!", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/541", "asked_by": "Manav Singh (Flibon)", "answers": [{"text": "same issue i also face pls sir help us fix this issue and provide us more token\n\nHTTP Request: POST <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> “HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests”\n\n![:red_circle:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_circle.png?v=12) A9 failed: ‘data’\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/543", "answered_by": "Yashvardhan (23f2004644)"}], "topic_id": "topic_164277", "question_id": 541}

{"question": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements.

The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n  1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n  2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n  3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n  1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**\n\n\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n  2. **Using requirements.txt**\n\n\n\n• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\n\n\n• If you **don’t specify a version** , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)** , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n• Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\n  * Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n  * Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.\n  * Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n  * Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\nKind regards", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/2", "asked_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)", "answers": [{"text": "Thank you sir for clarifying.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/48/56317_2.png) carlton:\n\n> • Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint.

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n[ ![The image is a stylized infographic with a muted color palette.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/94", "asked_by": "Swapnila Chakrabarty (swapnila04)", "answers": [], "topic_id": "topic_166576", "question_id": 94}

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py  \nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile  \nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n  1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n  2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.\n  3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n  4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:  \nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n  5.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/1", "asked_by": "Swapnila Chakrabarty (swapnila04)", "answers": [], "topic_id": "topic_168057", "question_id": 1}

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n  1. The chaos of ROE.\n  2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n  3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n  4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n  5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**\n  6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n  7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n  8. How limited the time is.\n\n\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  \nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\nKind regards", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/15", "answered_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)"}], "topic_id": "topic_168449", "question_id": 14}

{"question": "Dear [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Anand](/u/anand) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi)\n\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n\n\nThis course did not list any **prerequisites** , leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds** —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n\nThe **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n\nMany students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback** , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.\n\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE** , which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding.

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n\n\n  * Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals** , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n  * The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n  * The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\n  1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2** , well in advance of the deadline.\n  2. **More structured and accessible support** , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\n  3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels** , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\n\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

In fact the [first page of the TDS course](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\n\n> **This course is quite hard**\n> \n> Here’s students’ feedback:\n> \n>   * It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n>   * Now it’s hard and covers more.

[#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n> \n\n> \n> **[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\n  2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - _Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help_  \nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\n\n> **We encourage learning by sharing**\n> \n> You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n> \n> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\n> \n> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\n> \n> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.\n\n  3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  \nOnce again Anand has a [nice blog](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/) where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.\n  4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n  5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - _Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them_ The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n  6. [@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/9", "asked_by": "Jayakrishnan (jkmadathil)", "answers": [{"text": "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\n\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\n\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks.

{"question": "Respected Sir,\n\nI noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\n\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.\n\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.\n\nPlease consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted  \nrollnumber 23f2001390", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/168832/120", "asked_by": "D HARICHARAN  (Haricharan)", "answers": [{"text": "[![Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/4/f47b7975124d71a2ac2f00c917d614035f42de4a_2_690x69.png)Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm1914×194 12.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/4/f47b7975124d71a2ac2f00c917d614035f42de4a.png \"Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm\")\n\nThe latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks.

{"question": "[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nDear Sir,  \nI have few questions. It is written in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2) that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n\n  1. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.  \nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\n  2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?  \nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.\n  3. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.\n  4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\n  5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\n  6. And many more\n\n\n\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.  \nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\n\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\n\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\n\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n\n  1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\n  2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\n  3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.\n\n\n\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\n\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n\n  1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI.\n  2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\n\n\n\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev> will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\n\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/28", "asked_by": "PREMDEEP MAITI (23f1001231)", "answers": [], "topic_id": "topic_169029", "question_id": 28}

{"question": "Hello Sir,\n\nI have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\n\n  1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.\n\n  2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\n\n  3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\n\n  4.

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\n\nI have another question.

Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\n  2. GA3 Q9\n\n     * Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.\n     * Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\n  3. GA4 Q2 & Q10\n\n     * Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.\n     * Reference: [GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98)\n  4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)\n\n     * Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\n     * Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\n  5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\n\n     * Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\n     * Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\n\n  1. Platform Capability for GA Tasks\n\n     * Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\n     * Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\n  2. File Upload Example via Platform API\n\n     * Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\n     * This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\n  3. General Observations on GA1-5  \nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine.

{"question": "[@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\n\n  1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**\n\n\n  * As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\n\n  * To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n\n  * However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.\n\n\n\n  2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**\n\n\n  * A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\n\n  * Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\n\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\n\n[![The image is a split-screen showing two different web page sections.

I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n\n  1. **Organization & Structure:**  \nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\n  2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  \nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\n  3. **Time Constraints:**  \nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\n  4. **Sessions & Support:**  \nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\n  5. **Deployment Variability:**  \nEach GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\n  6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  \nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\n  7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  \nEven for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\n\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit.

The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.\n\n\n\nThis test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment.

Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them.

I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material.

We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\n\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> They explained what should be your approach?

I can summarise it in these words:  \nCreate a server api that receives a request.  \nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.  \nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\n\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\nSince this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\n\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\n\n  1. Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\n  2. Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\n  3. Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\n  4. Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n\n\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\n\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\n\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\n\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\n\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\n\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\n\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.\n\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.** Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\n\nNow is a good time to start.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\n\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\n\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\n\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\n\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\n\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\n\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\n\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\n\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2002668/48/66999_2.png) 23f2002668:\n\n> It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\n> \n> Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.\n\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.\n\nBut thank you for your feedback.\n\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\n\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\n\nKind regards,  \nTDS team", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/314", "answered_by": "Carlton D'Silva (carlton)"}, {"text": "Hi, I have a few things to say\n\n\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\n\n\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\n\n> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n\n  * Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\n  * ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\n  * There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\n\n\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.\n\nIn both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\n\n\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)[On another topic](/t/99838/2)\n\n> **What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.\n\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\n\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\n\nNow I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\n\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\n\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an _**implicit**_ way.\n\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\n\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\n\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\n\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\n\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects.

But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14)\n\nThen I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files** , or queried in **non-standard formats** like “code -s” or “code -v”.\n\nThe next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. ![:cross_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14)\n\n* * *\n\n\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n\n![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14) Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`  \n![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14) Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution  \n![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14) Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`  \n![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more  \n![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14) Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**\n\n* * *\n\n\nVicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.\n\n\n![:brain:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14) **Graded Assignment Solver**  \nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\n\n  * `code -s` / `code -v` → VS terminal commands\n  * Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\n  * GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\n  * Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\n\n\n\n![:open_file_folder:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/open_file_folder.png?v=14) **File Upload with Query Matching**  \nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries.

{"question": "[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nSir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.\n\n  1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response\n  2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  \na. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  \nb. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  \nwhereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”\n\n\n\nThe logs from Cloud Run  \n\n\n[![The image displays a log of HTTP requests, likely from a web server.

However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/lakshaygarg654/48/129814_2.png) lakshaygarg654:\n\n> **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/lakshaygarg654/48/129814_2.png) lakshaygarg654:\n\n> ### 3\\.

{"question": "[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nI’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\n\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\n\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\n\n  1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\n\n  2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.\n\n  3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\n\n  4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\n\n\n\n\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.\n\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.\n\nI hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.\n\nThanks and Regards", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/72", "asked_by": "Khushi Shah (23f2005471)", "answers": [], "topic_id": "topic_171141", "question_id": 72}

{"question": "I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades.\n\nAs outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.\n\nFor students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.\n\nGiven that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these", "question_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/43", "asked_by": "Naman Gupta (Namannn28)", "answers": [], "topic_id": "topic_172246", "question_id": 43}

I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\n\n  1. Redundancy in Option A:  \nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\n\n  2. Simplicity in Filtering:  \nFiltering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\n\n\n\n\nTime → for checking the hour and weekday.\n\nMethod → to filter only POST.\n\nURL → to ensure the request is under /images/.\n\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\n\n  3. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices:  \nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/5", "answered_by": "Shambhavi  (24f2003130)"}, {"text": "Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story.
